My name is [Sebastian Schoenherr](http://seppinho.github.io/images/seb.jpg) and I'm a researcher (PhD in Computer Science) at the [Division of Genetic Epidemiology](http://genepi.i-med.ac.at), [Medical University of Innsbruck](http://www.i-med.ac.at). 
I'm part of a small **computational genetic lab**.

The focus in our lab is on methods development and creating Software-As-A-Service (SaaS) approaches to achieve reproducible science in the area of Genetics. I'm a big fan of Hadoop and work with it since several years. 
Check out my [projects](http://seppinho.github.io/projects) for more details on that.

I'll try to [blog](http://seppinho.github.io/) on a regular basis just to remember things I did in the past.
Please provide a [pull request](https://github.com/seppinho/seppinho.github.io) if something is inaccurate, not working or completely wrong.
