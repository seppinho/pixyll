Hi,
[I'm](http://seppinho.github.io/images/seb.jpg) a computational biologist based in the alps ([Innsbruck](https://www.innsbruck.info/en/), Austria) and develop software for geneticists/biologists. 
Currently, my main software projects are [Michigan Imputation Server](https://imputationserver.sph.umich.edu), [HaploGrep](http://haplogrep.uibk.ac.at/) and [mtDNA-Server](https://mtdna-server.uibk.ac.at). I'm a big fan of Hadoop, [open-source software](https://github.com/seppinho) and biorxiv. Check out my [publications](https://scholar.google.at/citations?user=xx6B8OUAAAAJ&hl=de) and [projects](http://seppinho.github.io/projects).

I also [blog](http://seppinho.github.io/) from time to time.
