Hi,
[I'm](http://seppinho.github.io/images/seb.jpg) a compuational biologist based in Innsbruck (Austria) and develop software for geneticists/biologists (e.g. [HaploGrep](http://haplogrep.uibk.ac.at/), [Michigan Imputation Server](https://imputationserver.sph.umich.edu)). The overall goal is provide methods as simple web services to everyone. I'm a big fan of Hadoop, GitHub and biorxiv. Check out my [projects](http://seppinho.github.io/projects) and [publications](http://seppinho.github.io/cites).

I'll try to [blog](http://seppinho.github.io/) on an regular basis.
