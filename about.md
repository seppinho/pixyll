Hi,
I'm a researcher (PhD in Computer Science) at the [Division of Genetic Epidemiology](http://genepi.i-med.ac.at), [Medical University of Innsbruck](http://www.i-med.ac.at) and member of a small **computational genetic lab**.

The focus in our lab is on methods development and creating Software-As-A-Service (SaaS) approaches to achieve reproducible science. I'm a big fan of Hadoop and work with it since several years. Check out my [projects](seppinho.github.io/projects) for more details on that.
