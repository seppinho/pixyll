Already some years  [ago](http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/13/200/abstract), Lukas Forer and I developed a platform to simplify the complete lifecycle of a Hadoop program. This includes steps like putting data into HDFS, execute a MapReduce job from the command line or export data back to the local file system. These steps are of course doable with some basic Unix knowledge. Nevertheless, for people who are used to work with graphical interfaces, this can be a major barrier to discover the beauty of Hadoop. For example, a typical MapReduce command looks like this:

{% highlight bash %} 
sudo -u cloudgene /usr/bin/hadoop jar /usr/lib/hadoop-0.20-mapreduce/hadoop-examples.jar wordcount input output
{% endhighlight %}

To abstract this command, we developed [Cloudgene](http://cloudgene.uibk.ac.at) consisting of (a) a workflow system and (b) a cloud orchestration platform. The idea behind Cloudgene is quite simple: If you are able to execute your Hadoop program on the command line, take some minutes and write a YAML configuration to connect your program with Cloudgene. With some YAML text lines  you are able transform your command line program into a web-based service ("Hadoop-As-A-Service"), present your collaborators a scalable best-practices workflow and provide reproducible science.
A typical YAML configuration file looks like this. Pleas find a working example [here](https://github.com/seppinho/mapreduce).
{% highlight yaml %} 
name: WordCount
description:  Integrates MapReduce-WordCount Simple (External Process) into Cloudgene.
version: 1.0
website: http://hadoop.apache.org/
mapred:
  steps:
    - name: Wordcount
      jar: Examples.jar 
      params: mapreduce.wordcount.WordCountSimple $input $output
  inputs:
    - id: input
      description: Input
      type: hdfs-folder
  outputs:
    - id: output
      description: Output
      type: hdfs-folder
      removeHeader: false
      download: true
{% endhighlight %}  

Cloudgene simplified our lives a lot in the last years, and two very recent services based on Cloudgene show the success of our platform: One of these services is the mtDNA-Server (http://mtdna-server.uibk.ac.at), a heteroplasmy and contamination pipeline for next generation sequencing data developed by my colleague [Hansi Wei√üenteiner](haplogrep.uibk.ac.at).
The other service will  be introduced in another blog post. 
For now, check out the mtDNA-Server web service to get a feeling what Cloudgene can do for you.

In the next post, I'll show you how you can combine the ideas of my [first](http://seppinho.github.io/docker/hadoop/2015/08/26/docker-hadoop/) blog post (Hadoop Docker Image) with Cloudgene resulting in a local Hadoop-As-A-Service approach.
