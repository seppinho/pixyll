In 2011 we published HaploGrep, a way to assign haplogroups to mtDNA profiles. It is now the defacto standard for 
haplogroup assignment with currently >2k users [each month](http://haplogrep.uibk.ac.at/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/haplogrep_phylotree1.png).

Over the last years we (especially Hansi) improved the software and I'm happy to announce that it has been **accepted by the NAR Web Server Issue 2016**.  

### Main Features of HaploGrep2
- Rule-based system allows to detect artificial recombinants and missing variants as well as annotating rare and phantom mutations
- Import VCF files
- Generate a publication ready graphical tree
- New export formats (VCF, multiple sequence alignment format, extended reports)
- New metrics (Hamming distance, Jaccard index, Kimura 2-parameter)
- Haplogroup discordance calculation between all 4 metrics
- Providing a Restlet API and a command line version of HaploGrep

Have fun with [HaploGrep2](http://haplogrep.uibk.ac.at) and check out the paper [here](http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2016/04/15/nar.gkw233.full.pdf+html).
